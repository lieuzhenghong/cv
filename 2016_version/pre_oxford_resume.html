		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<div class="content">
<p>I am an A-Level graduate with the Hwa Chong Diploma with Merit, looking for a suitable internship to broaden my horizons before matriculating and starting work full-time.
    
<p> An inquisitive mind who always strives to improve and seek excellence, I wish for a working experience that will challenge me and force me to think critically. 
    
<p> I am passionate about helping the underprivileged and learning as much as I can about software development, and I marry the two by teaching disadvantaged children programming and computational thinking.</p>
